"Bad Guys With Guns" - My entry for the Ludum Dare 42 jam.

This is VERY bad code. 

I can't create creative names so I chose "Bag Guys With Guns" (My ludum dare 40 game was titled "The game about killing the Ninja on the right").

The goal of the game is to make it as far as you can, however I doubt you will pass round 12.
Rules
 Enemies will come at you from all sides, and you have to kill them before they kill you!
 The closer enemies are to you, the more accurate they will be. Don't let them get near you.
 New and harder enemies will spawn as the game progresses.
 Each round you are awarded $400. Use that money to buy weapons and armour (I can't make good GUI).
 Light Armour reduces damage by around 20% while heavy armour reduces damage by around 40%.

Controls
 W - Move forward in direction of mouse
 LMB - Shoot
 Space - Restart (When dead)
